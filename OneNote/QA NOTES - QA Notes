# Integration Testing - Testing involves Test Cases merged from other projects (not all Test Cases), to make sure 
old/recent functionalities that was added to previous project and been signed off to production are still working in 
New Release. 

# Sanity Check - Rational (good/expected/reasonable) behavior. Nothing is broken, working as expected
# USER ACCEPTANCE TESTING (UAT) Known as (Beta Testing, End User Testing) - Last Phase of Testing. Testers test software to make sure it can handle
required tasks in Real World Scenerios. (Most final and critical procedure before software is rolled out to market)

#SMOKE TESTING = Done before Regression Testing. It aims to ensure that MOST important functions are working. The result of this testing 
is to decide if a build is stable enough to proceed with further testing. 

# REGRESSION TESTING - making sure that older programming still works with new changes
	-This Testing makes sure that product works fine as previously with newly added features/changed features
	- we need more than smoke. We're using regression as a means to generate transactions. 
	We need to generate invoice messages, and we need to generate events. At a bare minimum, we need to run bulk. 
	- For PYPE testing - Smoke and Bulk Testing will be just fine (Bulk - is portion of regression)
#To set Price Override Price restriction for particular customer, SQL query is in "SQL Queris" tab
	- Flag is set in the POSDATA db, Table: "customer_flag_assignment"

# Check with Typewriters, BSA, if there is only one Data Table is used or SEVERAL Tables to pull Data Information from
#Items in history are being deleted after 90 days by dayend

# NO TAX show on Deferred Core Customer
# Approval Required prompt will display when Large Return is processing, Price Override, Tax Exemption and Refrigerant (Freon) Purchase
# Autocosted is done by doing Item Sourcing with Item that don't have pricing yet (Catalog -> Item sourcing -> save invoice with Retail Customer)
	Manual costing is done thru Management Function -> Item Costing button
	Perform DayEnd to take effect. Autocosting (auto costing) should not happen for Items not in Item_master
# Billing the customer (QOH will go 0 -> -1) BUT Stock transfer from another location (QOH will go -1 -> 0)

# Freon Items (FRE)
	Will give prompt when buying freon item - License information prompt to enter <Name>, <Licence #>, and 
	<exporation date>, after prompt, it will give another prompt "Approval required" 
	In JSON, it would be under; "freonSaleInfo"
# Customer Type is in "Customer Type" tab
# Customer Load Request - "No customer found" error
-- Sysdev2
Select * from arsys1.cmaster where ccust# = <CustomerNumber>
	- If customer  not showing, then that's why you get that error. 
	- The customers loaded on the test boxes did not come from sysdev2. they have been copied from box to box
	- CRECCD - If Field is NOT blank, it will NOT Load customer
	- The Customer Load is performed thru "Search Corporate" button  

# Load customer (loadcustomer, add customer, add user, backoffice, ldap, webtesting, passwordload)
To load customer onto Box - must know store number box associated with
1. Look into Wikilink- under "Adding manager access to user" - Follow exact steps - BEST METHOD
2. Second method is Go into Backoffice from different box where that user ID is present, Copy all values and 
Add that user to Your box, (with no user), and paste the Values for that box - Backoffice
3. Third method, Automation ppl have process of loading customer, ask them for help

#Transmit
# PSP - Production System Patch - In Production - Runs after DayEnd, and PSP kicks in around 1am to install all the patches
that are in queue, normally patches installed in Corporate would transmit to Stores, and Installs. 
 - Transmit usually runs in the middle of night. Ozark1 controlling transmit - it sending the files to Stores. 
	- Transmit can run while store is selling parts (open) but not recommended, will cause lockups, 
		- Files/Programs that are included in Transmit:
			§ DayEnd
			§ JISRGZC (reorganize files)
			§ Releasing installs/Patches
			§ Any process that does massive updates to any files

# Employee account - (Teammember, team member, workers)
TM account is same as professional account, they stored in same table (jcust). Thought, 
they have flag set for CMEMPC = Y, where for other accounts, it is blank. 

# Retail customers and Pro customers are stored in Retaildata
	Type = 'p' for pro and 'r' for retail
	Retaildata are locally stored customers and MDM is corporate stored customers
	Change/Unlock MDM account - more info in "People tab" -> Vacation
#A daily customer's balance is calculated daily...at the store...but they also have a corporate balance, because even though the customers are SUPPOSED to pay daily...they usually don't
JDPFIL at the store  - Daily Pay File
Add all their invoices for a given day, and you have their daily balance

##To find out store# in case someone changed it IN POS
Go to "Reprint Invoices/Receipt" 
Click on Invoice
Store# will be shown at the Bottom of Invoice
--ORF
 Click on "Purchase Inquiry" 
 
# Gift Cards - I have queries to pull Active gift cards (have few already listed), Load gift cards with money

https://confluence.oreillyauto.com/display/ITRetailSolutionDesign/iSM+-+Technical+Design+Specifications+-+400+Down#iSM-TechnicalDesignSpecifications-400Down-SynchronizationServices

# Store and Forward (saf) - CCT related
It means that in a comm down situation we will store sales up to $100 on the CCT 
and then upload those later when the store is back online. 
It Upload to Aurus and payment processing. We can manually kick off the upload process. In production it happens in the early AM hours
# Store and Forward - as400Down related
Term used to describe data flow. When as400 is down, data will be STORED in postgres, and FORWARDED to AS400 once its up. 
Core_return is copied to jwcret table every 15 min as long as 400 is up, it will not transfer instantly, even when its goes UP 
 
# Batteries in store (production) Items include dash (ex: SSB 22-73) are no longer present in stores. Item without dashes
only, will work in stores (ex: SSB 54EX). Database issue. In test, will work both ways. 
 #ThinClient - thinclient
	- If properties or flags been triggered, must restart ThinClient to take effect

# As400 Down - project and putting as400 database status "down" (as400down)
	- toggling the as400 down doesn't actually shutdown or disconnect the as400. It just tells the linux box that the as400 is down so don't bother talking to it.
            but if the as400 actually went down or was unreachable (not just a software toggle), then you wouldn't be able to run queries against it
PTEST-215036 - Routine for Toggling AS400 Down/Up (curl command)

curl http://posrest:18080/ism-bridge-war/as400/down  - Checking status of AS400
# Past Due Inquiry, Balance Inquiry -> "Account Balance Detail" and could be other Customer report details are 
Relied on Web Service that Finance Team developed. It would pull data from Production bc there is no Test or Dev 
Layer to verify and see. 
Those numbers from Account Balance detail screen only can be changed via Production stores not from here (test)

#Table Sync (time, schedule, trigger, updates)

Data AS400 tables and Data in Postgres tables

# Hotfix - There are average of 2-10 issues in one hotfix that has to be done by End of Day.
	- The process is, After Hotfix patch is build and applied, We begin to test, Bulk Regression may also be running
	- Bulk regression and Testing can happen simultaneously, with NO disruptive testing like DayEnd. 
	- Bulk Regression is portion of Regression -takes 2.5 hrs + 30 min for Regression Review
	- Normal Regression = Full regression- longer time
	- Once regression is done, Testing is done, Disruptive testing may begin, Tests that require Dayend. 
	- Hotfix is something that happens in production (stores report) and must be fixed Immediately
	- Choosing TestBox for hotfix to test is depending on store that has whatever ENACTOR version installed
		Ex: if its 3.5.0, then we must test on testbox with 3.5.0 version
		Ex: if its 3.4.0 then  we must test on testbox with 3.4.0 version 
	
	- R3.4.0 Hotfix - All hotfixes I worked on. Bugs with QA Test notes on how to test them: 
	- Epic Link = R3.4.0.3 (Hotfix)
	- Labels = Ops_HotIssue and/or R3.4.0.3_Target

# Backup and Recovery (button at Tender Selection) - PTEST-207888
# Outside Purchase Ledger or Outside Purchase (OSP - Purchasing Supplies from Different companies
	- Customer wants part that we Oreilly don't stock, they still want to purchase thru us, so we order/buy part
	From different company and then ship it to Customer. 
	• Select Retail customer -> Product Ordering & Inquiry -> Outside Purchase Ledger -> Create new PO (RETAILMNT-21683)
# How hub Routing works | hub | hub manifest
Store Generates stock transfer (QA can Generate too),  (Item Transfer)(Item Source- OPP)
TeamNet Sets up Hub Routes
Corporate Sends Hub Routes to hub stores
And it triggers the Pype_message 

# Hub Routes Data - datawhse and sysdev2
Look for hubdropoff, hubmanifest, hubmanifestlocation, hubmessage, hubroute, hubrun, hubstop.
--datawhse or sysdev
Select * from dwdata.hubroute
https://confluence.oreillyauto.com/display/ITRetailSolutionDesign/Hub+Manifest+Improvements+-+Technical+Specifications
	- This test case has steps to Create Manifest via Customer Service UI PTEST-191355
	- Manifest can also be created thru Item Sourcing or Stock Transfer (Dayend may be required)
	- Customer Service UI is best way for Creating Manifest
	- ROPP-2006 - steps in comments per Tyler
	- PTEST-191355 - Another version of placing manifest order

# Large Refund - Only scenario user will get an old prompts for Refund to occur at tendering would be a non-cod customer
that originally put the sale of the items "On Account" and then they would try to get cash back instead of putting it back on the account.
Retail and COD customers would see the large refund approval needed at finish invoice on the manager approval prompt.

PRINT/Invoice/Employee Sale (employee, tm)
#Team Members Pro Customer- All transactions for team members will print off on Thermal Printer (instead of Laser) 
except for (charge on account = Laser printer)
	- POAs print on laser, regardless of COD status
	-All Professional customers (On Account and COD and NonCOD) prints off on Laser Printer
	-Employee purchases (Team member) purchase will have an Green Icon of Suite Case next to their Name
	-Receipt will also say "Team Member Purchase" if employee purchased something 
	
#Online Store  - print invoice
	- Invoice - Prints off on Thermal Printer
	- Pick Ticket - Prints off on Laser Printer
	- Pick Ticket is Paper that prints off for Team Member. To find Particular Part in store to give out to Customer.
	- Pick Ticket tells TM where part is located, what type of part, Quantity.

##Customer Information
#Non-Professional (Retail)(999990) customer PRINTS on Thermal Receipt
#Professional (With No Account)(999991) customer PRINTS on Thermal Receipt
#On Receipt - No Customer information should be present
#On "reprint Invoice/Receipt - Only <Phone number>/<Customer Number> ("999990")/"COD Customer"/"Retail Customer" are displayed
#No address is displayed on Invoice VR

#CCT - Thermal Printer
1. Press button while restarting the printer
2. Press button how many times you need to get to your setting
		##To Acquire IP address for that printer is connected to ##
Press 3 times
Press 5 times
Then wait for it to print IP address
 
#Pity/petty Cash Account - Company Accounts
#Markup price - The Markup Price Service takes the item cost provided by the caller and determines what price the customer should pay based on their customer group
	ItemCost =  price that costed company to buy that Item
	(IMSCST) StoreCost = price that warehouse sells item to the Store
	(IMCORP) CorePrice
	(IMCORC) CoreCost
#ItemCost =  price that costed company to buy that Item
#StoreCost = price that warehouse sells item to the Store OR What Store paid for the Item
#Price/Each - Amount the customer will pay
Example of StoreCost = If a store goes to a dealership and buys an oil filter for $5, they would put $5 in the store cost. The price field would be the recommend sale price, but you can change the sale price to any amount.
--------------------------------------------------- Core --------------------------------------------------
# Deferred Core Customer - Company's that PAY for deferred cores later, NOT on the spot. Like end of month	
Any customer that starts with '999' example 999501, is an Oreilly's Customer, and typically we don't sell to Oreilly's customers. 	
	- Item price with core example: Item: 200$ Core: 69$. Total cost would be 269$ plus tax. 
	If core is returned (old part from the car) That 69$ will be returned back to Customer.  
	IMCORP = Core price = is the one shows on VR as core price
	IMCORP (core price)- store charges customer
	IMCORC (Corporate Cost/ Core Cost)- corporate charges manufacturers
	
# Returns: When doing Battery as New Return - qty 3, it gives output qty of 1. It is EXPECTED for a warranty 
or warranty replacement on a battery...BUT not for a core, and not for a new return. 
	- The reason warranty and warranty replacement is different is because battery warranties have to be prorated based on the original purchase date
# Core Exchange - It item comes with core, "Core Exchange" Removes Core Cost
# Core Charge - Amount that will be refunded to customer after they bring (core) Old part back from vehicle
	The bigger core amount or bigger core charge, better for Customer, will get more in return for old part.
	 
Query to Display Deferred Cores
-- AS400
Select *
from jbrdata.jdfrcor

AND OR
Run following Query to change due date for Deferred Cores - Will display in "Process Past Due Deferred Cores"
UPDATE jbrdata.jdfrcor
SET dcdudt = (CURRENT_DATE - 1 DAY)

 --AS400 - Past Due Inquiry
	Select *
	from jbrdata.jcmpast

#Warranty Return - if warranty return is done, the part will go back to Warehouse, and warehouse may send it back to Manufacturing for credit or repair
	- if part that was installed but did not fit on vehicle is being returned, it will be processed as "Warranty return"
#Warranty Replacement - Return - This will show on VR pricing as Each: 0.00 and Total: 0.00 and Tax: N
#New Return - if New Return is done, the part may either go back on Shelf or returned to Warehouse. 
	- if part that customer did not need anymore, it will be processed as "New Return" and go back on Shelf
#New Return VS Transaction Recall - If customer has invoice with them, Transaction Recall is best way. 
	If customer don't have invoice, then New Return is better
#Core Return - Return - Item with Core has <Retail_core_price>, On VR on Core Return, Core Charge Price
        will display as "Each" with negative sign
	
#Warranty code - There are specific warranty code could be found in Confluence page. "Warranty Codes"
	- I got File downloaded in "Download" Folder
	- Query for Warranty Description
		- AS400
	Select *
	from jbrdata.jimwar
	where wrcode = 'EnterWarrantyCode'

# "Process Past Due Deferred Core" - this menu will show Cores that are expired/late, meaning if customer bought part that has a core charge,
They will pay that Core Charge, BUT if they DONT return their core from their Vehicle within certain timeframe, That customer will NOT
Get reimbursed for their Core (item from their vehicle) and It will display in "Display Deferred Core" 
 
# Display Deferred Core - Items that were bought with Core (Core Charge) but Core Has NOT been returned to store yet
# Shrink (Mark Deferred Cores as "Shrink" for Customer)
An Example would be: Customer Satisfaction. If Customer Lost or didn't bring the core back, or refuse to pay for the core, employee or Manager can mark that Item as "Shrink" as if customer brought the core back, or paid for the core, and the Item would go away from the list as if process completed as normal. 

#Verified Returns - New Return/Warranty Return/Transaction Recall - Customer buys an Item WITH customer info given Then Comes back to Return it. Verifying Returned item against the Invoice

#Non-Verified Returns - New Return/Warranty Return - Customer makes Sale and Does Not give customer info Then Returns item without a receipt. Status must be "Not found Locally" and Must click button "Return Without Receipt

##POSREST - Basically POSREST is a service that OPS needs to function. Without is running, cannot sell parts or do much of anything in OPS

##TKT items (Local Event - the once Oreilly supports - Monster truck event/Rally Race/Events that has to do with cars) - when ticket is added to VR, a customer numbered 999518 automatically be entered
	- TKT can only be sold as Separate Invoice (No other non-ticketing "Items" can be added)
	- Employees usually told which tickets for whatever event they have in store for sale and how to sell them (Item and line number)
	- Those tickets located in JIMAST, same as all the other items
	- New 'TKT' Pricing can be found in NPC Database. Query is within this notes under NPC <above> 
	
##YM.COM (YourMechanic.com) - Type of Customers - Professional customers. Just like Firestone, Tire shops. 
	- They have options as "Non-Delivery Customer" check box
	- They Buy stuff online and Must bring PO for a Match
	- They Bring their PO. Their PO number must match when they come into Store to Pick up the Items
#YMM - Year/Make/Model - In RCAT
#S/E - Submodel/Engine in RCAT
#LP - License Plate in RCAT

#Tax - VR Phase 2  - The tier tax display (T1, T2, T3, NA) is being replaced with Y and N - Yes and No
#Tax is also can be based on State, type of customer based on State, Item based on State - All tested every month as RSU
#Tax Exemption - Cancels taxes completely from Sale (Getting rid of taxes)
#Tax - JCUST - CMTAXC = R
	JIMAST - IMTAXCLASS = 'TPP'
		Means NO tax has been applied or charged
# There are Tax Exempt customers (pro Cust) and usually have TaxCode = 'D' - Direct Permit Pay (google it)
	- Does not charge Tax
	- Retail Customers or other Pro Customers can be Tax Exempt thru Discounts/Overrides button
	
# Determine if VERTEX (tax failed over)-SubTotal and TotalTax should be Way off from each other (in numbers)
VERTEX is Set to 100% to determine how far off tax fails over. (Bug:OPSR-4741, TC:PTEST-98634)
	- Vertex determines the tax rate for each customer (if comms are down in stores, they use back up cache to pull taxes)
	- Normal tax rate is usually from 6-11%. 
	- If fail over is 99%, the TotalTax will be way off and SubTotal and TotalTax will be very close with each 
	Other in numbers. 
	Ex: SubTotal is 6.76 
		TotalTax is 5.00 (tax fail over)(When normally it should be around .45 cents)
		- Problem why Vertex (tax) failover sometimes is 
		(It's happening because posrest isn't up before vertex initializes, so it fails to get the store number)
		(Basically, it doesn't initialize properly, which results in the logs filling up and eating up memory.)
# Once tax override is applied to a product (Item) - Tax is removed, then adding "Retail Customer" will remove the Tax override 
And tax will show on VR

# Token Transaction - token or number that is being recorder in the system for a specific card once it being swiped. Once the Customer decides to make a return, They will swipe the same card, if it matches the Token (number of card swiped before for purchase) it will process Return successfully. 

#OriginalAurusPayTicket - Linux command that will result in number (trace invoice) that will be sent to Aurus for Credit given back to us.  
	- In json:  AurusPayTicketNumber - 
grep 'AurusPayTicketNumber' /usr/local/oreilly/tomcat/logs/cct.log | grep 'ws###' | egrep -io '<AurusPayTicketNumber>'[0-9]\{18\}''


#If CCT Card Transaction will deny, but when user tries different ITEM and it Approves, then the Problem could be in Pricing Amount
	- Certain pricing are to be denied. Refer to Derek for details

# Tailing logs
Tailing logs is when accessing logs from something that is already happened or ability to watch what is happening live.
Command: tail -f /usr/local/oreilly/logs/cron/root/heartbeats.log
Command: tail -n 1 /directory/fileName	--Replace "/directory/fileName" with the needed filepath

## Hearbeats - is a program
if posrest is not responding and has been running for more than 5 minutes heartbeats thinks it's in a bad state and restarts it
however it shouldn't be that unresponsive.

##Moving Item From JIMAST back to JNSPR and Verifying it

# STH - Ship to Home - After Item has been boxed and shipped thru YETI, the autoload will happen (Item must be Sourced)
	Only then, QOH would decrease, 
# BOPIS - the item gets added to the basket and that’s when autoload happens and QOH would be set to 0

	1. call chglib/movjnspr parm('LINE' 'ITEM')
PTEST-79001
Step 20, 21, 22

# In JINVMOV - If item is Autoload = false or Not Loaded, and when it is added to Basket with complete sale, it will show
In JINVMOV table with second line column 'IVTRANTYPE' of 'InquiryAutoload'. But should show only once. 
ISM-6534 - issue indicates, step 12 that 'InquiryAutoload' shows twice - wrong. 
          The bug was opened because it happened a second time after the return was finished.
#JINVMOV table - should have two lines for Item. First line for Autoload with Before: 0 and After: 0
	Second line with Before: 0 and After: -1 when completing e-commerce order (ship to home or BOPIS)

#Invoices for Stock Transfers located in "Reprint/Invoice Receipt" and Click on "Stock Transfer" button

# Reason Code for Lost Sale (lostsale)
"Lost Sale" is if customer walks in to store and wants to buy a part but that part is out of stock or not stocked in that store for
various reasons. Item Sourcing could be done in that situation BUT customer don't want to wait and says, "ill buy from different store"
Store/Company just lost a sale for that item. Then they would log that item into Lost Sales under Stock Transfer button.   
	- Enter or use the drop-down to select the reason code. Only characters 'I', 'P', or 'Q' can be entered. 
		"I" = Insufficient Inventory
		When using the "I" reason code, quantity is limited to 20 on stocking items, 100 on non-stocking items. Exception: It item is a stocking item and JDQ > 1, quantity is limited to 10 X JDQ. 
	- "P" = Pricing
		If the team member uses the "P" reason code for a lost sale based on pricing reasons and F6 is selected, a competitor needs to be identified on the next screen GOE200. 
		GOE200 - Price Override Competitor Name Selection
	- "Q" = QOH Error 
	- GOE105 allows team members to enter and log an item as a "Lost Sale" in OPS. If the "P" reason code is used to confirm a lost sale, GOE200 is executed for the team member to select or add a competitor. 
	- GOE105 - Lost Sales Entry (pgm)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#RGS - Returned Goods Slip - This is where employees would fill out forms for the record
	- Customer wants a part that store does not stock nor in warehouse. Then Store orders it from a Vendor via Career.

# Access Historic Invoice Inquiry 
When an invoice is created in a store, the invoice details are saved in the store's computer system, and a copy is sent to the data warehouse computer system for permanent storage. The invoices remain viewable on the store's computer system for 90 days. Once an invoice becomes 91 days old, it is automatically removed from the store system but it remains permanently available for viewing in the data warehouse system. The Historical Invoice Inquiry system is the utility used to view invoice information on the data warehouse system.
