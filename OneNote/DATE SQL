Date SQL Format

#DATE
Select Month(current date), Day(current date), Year(current date), ohdate
FROM JBRDATA.JQOH
(show results)

#DATE
Select (Month(current date) * 10000) + (Day(current date) * 100) + (Year(current date) - 2000), ohdate
From jbrdata.jqoh
(MDDYY)

Select ADD_MONTHS('11/12/19', 3) - adds 3 months/(-3) subtracts 3 months
Select MONTHS_BETWEEN('12/12/19', '02/23/12') - gives results of how many months in between

#TIME FORMAT
Insert(Insert(Char(OHTIME), (Length(Trim(Char(OHTIME))) - 1), 0, ':'), 
(Length(Trim(Char(OHTIME))) - 3), 0, ':') As "ChangeTime", 

### DEFINITIONS:

TRIM() function removes the space character OR other specified characters from the start or end of a string.

By default, the TRIM() function removes Left and Right spaces from a string.
EX: Select Trim(' Sample ')
(show result) = ('Sample')

Note: LTRIM removes all white spaces from the beginning of the string.
      RTRIM removes all white spaces at the end of the string.
	
#CHAR() (Character) - Converts Integer, Decimal, Number, BigDecimal INTO a Character (String)
IF you comparing two tables (DATE) and in one Table - (DATE) an Integer, The other Table (DATE) an String, IT simply won't read the table, will not show results
Its good habbit to convert data in both tables into a STRING

Length() (LEN) = Returns how many letters in a String (If there is "spaces", it will include them. "Los Angeles" returns 11)
EX: Select Length(String)
	From Sample
(show results) = 6
(LENGTH) also allows to move symbols within the STRING

EX: Insert(Insert(Char(OHTIME), (Length(Trim(Char(OHTIME))) - 1), 0, ':'), (Length(Trim(Char(OHTIME))) - 3), 0, ':') As "ChangeTime"
Length of (OHTIME)(MTTSS)(24419) = 5
++5 minus(-1) = 4 (Moves 4 spaces from the START)
++5 minus(-3) = 2 (Moves 2 spaces from the START)
Semicolon(:) moves (left)(-1) one space AND (left)(-3) three spaces 
(show resulting) 2:44:19

	
INSERT is diff. from Insert Into - Inserts character into results
INSERT(string, position, number, string2)

string:	Required. The string that will be modified(replaced)
position:	Required. The position where to insert the string2 (Start front of word)
number:	Required. The number of characters to replace
string2:	Required. The string to insert into string

EX: SELECT INSERT("W3Schools.com", 1, 9, "Example")
(show results) - Example.com

Hard Example: Insert(Insert(Char(OHTIME), (Length(Trim(Char(OHTIME))) - 1), 0, ':'), (Length(Trim(Char(OHTIME))) - 3), 0, ':') As "ChangeTime"
(show results)(default: Time(hmmss) - 94152) - 9:41:52   

Tricky AND/OR clauses (Order of Operation)
Select * from Emp
Where (COM is NULL OR COM = 0)
And Sal > 1100 AND Sal < 5000 AND Sal <> 1500
++This will run true because OR in in Parenthesis
