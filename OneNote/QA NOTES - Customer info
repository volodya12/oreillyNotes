# JSPRC - Table that contains Special Price Customers. A flag 'Y' should be set for CMSPRC in JBRDATA.JCUST for Special Pricing Cust. 
-----This step is only performed for customer accounts who have special/flex pricing. These accounts are identified with a 'Y' value in the CMSPRC field in the JCUST file. If a customer has this flag, then you need to look in the JSPRC file for that customer account number. The records for that account number show you the line code (SPLINE), product line (SPPLCD), and product subcode (SPSUBC) for items that this customer has flex pricing on. The JSPRC file also shows the discount type (SPDTYP) and the pricing percentage (SPUPP) that is used in the flex pricing formula.
--Price WILL NOT Adjust (even for Special Price Customers) if (SPDTYPE) is (JP)  -- Find this information in (Price Comparisons) Confluence page.
