Research workjob - if dayend is stuck
1)  WRKACTJOB
2)  look for any unusual jobs or jobs in MSGW.  i saw CLEANUP, which runs early in the morning.  it shouldn't be there at this time-of-day
3)  look at the job log for the CLEANUP job (option 5, option 10, [F10], [F18])
4)  look at the repeating message at the bottom of the clean-up job ("Cannot allocate object JCS301UPDA.")
5)  do a WRKOBJLOCK on the thing that's locked (JCS301UPDA)
6)  check the job log of the job that's locking the object
7)  determined that the job shouldn't still be signed on
8)  ended the job

if you're not sure about a job, ask me.  please
even if you're reasonably sure the job should be ended, go ahead and ask me.  i'll be happy to check it out and give you the all-clear or let you know to leave it alone
