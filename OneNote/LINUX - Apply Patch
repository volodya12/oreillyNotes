LINUX - Apply Patch 

INSTALLING A PATCH

# Review the StagedPatch - avoid patches with installed with .epc (those will take hours to install)

	1. Display current Staged Patches
ls -ltr /usr/local/oreilly/patchStage/

	2. Install All Staged Patches 
sudo sh -c '/usr/local/oreilly/bin/processStagedPatches.sh -d -f 2>&1 | tee -a /usr/local/oreilly/logs/cron/root/processstagedPatches.log'

	3. getVersions.sh - Get Current Version
-----------------------------------------------------------------
#Removing Staged Patches
--Verify if there is a directory, as well as a file with an ".md5" file extension, of the patch needing removed
	sudo rm -r /usr/local/oreilly/patchStage/<patchName>*

--Include the "To" and "From" versions in the patch name, and leave the asterisk symbol on the end, as this will catch the directory as well as the ".md5" file
--If the patch was removed, then it will no longer display in this output
--Example: secUpdates-14.4.2017.9.17.0--secUpdates-14.4.2017.9.24.0*
--Example: sudo rm -r /usr/local/oreilly/patchStage/\!disableIPSInvoicing--disableIPSInvoicing-1.0.0*
