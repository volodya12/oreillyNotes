@here the ISM-6213 issue has QBATCH blocked on 9990. can we get some direction on that, please?
#Tag Devs in Retail_Pos chat if its really important

# Daily Customer Cannot be Loaded into the OPS (Store) 
Currently, Daily Account Customers should only be loaded at one store, To get them Loading different stores, they must contact 'Credit department' but that will cause account balance issue. 
# COD Customers - If Removed - will not load Backup, Need to have Dev do it

# How to write JSON Queries
SELECT data->>'activityCode' as activityCode, data->>'enabled' as enabled 
from public.customers where data->>'customerNumber' = '196801'

# Mods needed
Reason why we don't make actual mods on other ppl TC's - we do in some cases
	- Less time for Reviewer to do 'Test Case Reviews'
	- The TC creator will never learn his mistakes, whats being changed on his Test and will continue to 
		make same mistakes and miss steps. 
	- Maybe there is a reason why they written it that way, and it may not need Mods or Changes

# Test Cases to properly write Verification steps/heading/labels and more

# Why use Tail command
- when testing is perfomed, tailing allows user to view the output
- It is good to Verify Null Point Exception (for Java)
- If user uses tail command, and sees error during test execution, it needs to be investigated
- Tail logs in comments ISM-6944

- tail command
tail -f /usr/local/oreilly/logs/enactor/999X.ws1XXX.20200629.1.HHMMSS.log

# Connection to Database on Linux Side NOT DBViz (establish connection)
1. Ssh to csa-t-pg-retail-1 (Corp to Store Connection) pass: <PC Log in>
2. Key: psql -d retail
3. Set up the connection and password by keying: alter role vkalmykov with password 'or3illy';
4. Or3illy is my password for csa-t-pg-retail-1 connection. Ctrl+d to end
5. Key "exit" ssh
6. If you can't connect in Dbviz then Network Team request must be made
7. Use it on Linux
8. Ssh to csa-t-pg-retail-1
9. Password is log in to pc pass
10. Key: psql -d retail 
11. Then enter SQL command. (;) must include at the end or it won't run
12. Ex: select * from sales_orders.customer_po_number_mask;
