$ Create "Meeting Notes" and record all notes and discussions have had with Devs/Managers - keep for record and everyone in team aware of whats going on
$ Create Another "Disruptive Time" Notes to where team members can put their scenarios of where they have to wait for long time to proceed with testing
 
$ Paste ALL Documentation Links to the Project Page
$ Create "Issue Worksheet" for all Test cases Templates 
$ Create "Retrospective" Page for people to give feedback

Make sure ALL tests are in "Ready for Execution" status
Create Test Plan and add Epic Link of EXECUTION
Move Test Case Template to Test Plan
	Segregate "DT - Disruptive Tests" into group - optional
Click "Start" on Test Plan to start Executing

$ Add Any Blockers/Notes into "Testing Interruptions" on Project Page - whats preventing you from testing
$ Create a Task "Down time Task" that interrupts (makes you wait) to continue further testing

# Record time loss in "Disruptive Testing" in Project Page, that could be fault of DayEnd, Dev's coding, Icarus run too long, Some Blocker.
