-- QA Notes - Fixing OPS/DayEnd --

------------------------------- Fixing Running dayend -----------------------------------------
with message: "Could not load the Device for ID:POS9998VKALMYKOV. Please Contact your administrator"

1. Navigate to linux command (test box)
2. Type "ls"
3.  "51.enactor 52.enactor Desktop enactor enactor2 logging vlad" (error message - 2 enactors showing)
4. sudo rm -r *.enactor

#Bash command: (disk free)
df -h
Look for /dev/dm-0		'Use%' - IF 100%, thats the problem. Contact Linux ppl (System Administrator) to free up disk space

#DayEnd report facts
	- Day Ends usually runs under QBATCH tab
	- IF QCTL is still present, Day End still running
	- If RUN_PO is in MSGW, need restart
	- SELW status. that means it's selecting records - may take Looong

#DayEnd - AS400 - Testboxes - If OPS not launching, Walk into "Batcave" and see if Particular Servers are powered on. (IF its blinking, then POWER OFF, the display should say "C B N" if its powered on)

#If user CANNOT VNC into OPS, Check for Disk free space on that Testbox

#DayEnd  - When trying to run DayEnd, it would go thru the steps but at the end, would Give an Error message. 
- This means, someone was Running PO Receivals (possibly in RPS - Retail Production System)(Someone was testing on that TestBox)
- This means, Some stores may receive Delivery earlier than store opens, and employee will sign and process that early delivered order into Computer. Which causes erruption of DayEnd
- Process: IN Legacy-> Master Menu -> #4 (Purchase order and Receival)-> #6 (Early Purchase order receival)

# If this messages shows "Could not load Location for ID: 9990, Please contact Administrator" 
	- This means that Problem occurred in Back Office. Need devs to look into that

##Open DayEnd issues are part of RETAIL MAINTENANCE

#JOB LOGS to look at, if DayEnd fails - Send to Devs for easy understanding for them
- Job logs sent to Programmers
#5 - 10 - Always scroll to very Button (most recent job logs) - Copy the first line: JOb/User/Number/System
#5 - 11 - Copy/Send whole thing to Programmers
#5 - 14 - F11 - Copy(Important columns: I/O Count and Relative Records Rows) Send whole thing
