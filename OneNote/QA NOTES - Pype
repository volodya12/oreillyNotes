-- QA Notes - Pype --

# Pype - change timing for Invoice transmit from store to Corporate (Ask Nolan or Greg for permission)
	- you change this property in (sudo vim)
/usr/local/oreilly/bin/gijoe/resources/properties/config.properties: legacy.pipe.files.create.frequency.minutes
i think the minimum you can set it to is 1

# priority is currently set to FIVE_MINUTE 
That property is in 
/opt/tomcat8/lib/properties/config.properties legacy.pipe.pype.message.priority=FIVE_MINUTE

# Select Invoices that went to Corporate - Equivalent to JORHSH & JORHSD
-- Sysdev
SELECT *
FROM DWPOSDATA.JHXMIT
WHERE STORE_NUMBER = :StoreNumber
AND INVOICE_NUMBER = :Invoice
AND INVOICE_DATE = :Date_YYYYMMDD

Corp to Store

# If NO INVOICES ending up in SYSDEV2 - Pype could be broken or Store changed  and invoices sent to different box and Sequence is out of order
	- Sysdev - Check Sequence number (must match with AS400 Box)
	
Select * from pypetest.strseq
where ssstr# = 4043

On TestBox AS400 - Telnet into System (10.xx.xx.1)
		- Dspdtaara jposndseq
			ยง Value: <example: 6226809 - this should match sysdev (query)
# Fix Sequence Pype Error between Sysdev and AS400 Box - when invoices not in Sysdev (from Nolan)
