		i. Contact Automation
		ii. Regression Analysis if Fail
		iii. Create bugs as needed
				1. Post New Bugs in Mattermost
		iv. Post Pass/Fail Status to Mattermost
	b. Issue Testing
		i. Select Issues from Test Lane
		ii. Create Test Case for Sprint Issue
				1. NOTE: These will probably only be run once or twice, so do not take too much time creating these
