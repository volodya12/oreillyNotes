-- QA Notes - Automated DayEnd --

When running Automated DayEnd
	- If Running DayEnd normally does not work
	
	1.  Check Store Close times

--AS/400 Query
SELECT effdate,closemon,closetue,closewed,closethr,closefri 
FROM jbrdata.strrules
WHERE effdate < CURRENT_DATE
ORDER BY effdate DESC
FETCH FIRST ROW ONLY

	2.  Change Store Time to Close

--AS/400 Query
UPDATE jbrdata.strrules
SET 
    closemon = (CASE WHEN DAYOFWEEK(NOW()) = 2 THEN '05:35:00' ELSE closemon END),
    closetue = (CASE WHEN DAYOFWEEK(NOW()) = 3 THEN '05:35:00' ELSE closetue END), 
    closewed = (CASE WHEN DAYOFWEEK(NOW()) = 4 THEN '05:35:00' ELSE closewed END),
    closethr = (CASE WHEN DAYOFWEEK(NOW()) = 5 THEN '05:35:00' ELSE closethr END),
    closefri = (CASE WHEN DAYOFWEEK(NOW()) = 6 THEN '05:35:00' ELSE closefri END)
WHERE effdate IN (
		SELECT MAX(effDate)
		FROM jbrdata.strrules
		WHERE effdate <= DATE(NOW())
)

	3. From Putty session (Gateway), choose option 36. 
	OR Run this command to run DayEnd (automated dayend)

	- Include red and blue link - as one command
	
	4. Change Store times back to Normal

--AS/400 Query
UPDATE jbrdata.strrules
SET 
    closemon = (CASE WHEN DAYOFWEEK(NOW()) = 2 THEN :CloseTime ELSE closemon END),
    closetue = (CASE WHEN DAYOFWEEK(NOW()) = 3 THEN :CloseTime ELSE closetue END), 
    closewed = (CASE WHEN DAYOFWEEK(NOW()) = 4 THEN :CloseTime ELSE closewed END),
    closethr = (CASE WHEN DAYOFWEEK(NOW()) = 5 THEN :CloseTime ELSE closethr END),
    closefri = (CASE WHEN DAYOFWEEK(NOW()) = 6 THEN :CloseTime ELSE closefri END)
WHERE effdate IN (
		SELECT MAX(effDate)
		FROM jbrdata.strrules
		WHERE effdate <= DATE(NOW())
)
