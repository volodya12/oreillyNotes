Char() - Converts an Integer to Character Value
Concat() - Returns a String from joining two or more string values

	- Trim('WhateverCharacters to be removed' FROM 'String to remove characters from') AS TrimmedString
	LTRIM - Left trim

	- Sometimes results can give you many duplicate values, that’s when you use DISTINCT
	- Ex: If results show too many same Cities (Puyallup, Tacoma, Federal way, Tacoma, Hola, Tacoma)
		- Select Distinct (Cities) - > will show only one of each city
Star (*) - can be used when joining more than one tables together and you want to include Column names from one Table only
	Select a.*
	From RWDATATST.ORDERH A
	Join RWDATATST.ORDERD B
Result -> only Columns in ORDERH will show
%	Represents zero or more characters	bl% finds bl, black, blue, and blob
