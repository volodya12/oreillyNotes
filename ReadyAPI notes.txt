#Composite Project

-Projects saved as single XML file, which makes it difficult to share among other testers, working on same project.
SEtting "Composite Project" to TRUE, the project is separated into multiple components.
-Environments can change endpoints, database connections, properties and more
-Event handlers can customize all aspects of API interactions/applies custom behavior to API calls

Quiz
Soap ui stores its project in XML
What is true about workspace
	You may only need one
	Workspaces does not stored in CSV files
When defining different configurations with different endpoints,
	Environment feature is use
What is reason to use an Event handler
	To apply custom behavior to all API Calls in project
Properties are best thought of as Variables
What is good way to share projectgs with colleagues
	Composite projectsa
Why soup ui project files get so big
	because they often contain complete WSDL
Reason to customize yoour proxy settings
	To work with your firewall
Where can user view Global Properties
	From File->Preference menu

#Manual API Interaction

Before interact/create Test Suites, first experiment with your Services and APIs
	Goal is to Validate basic behavior
Creating New Project
	Definitions - Examines resource and automatically determines types to use
	EndPoint - Test live API with specific method
	Integration - Allows to test Third party APIs
	Discover API - records HTTP/HTTPS traffic to API. Uses external client applications or browsers record clicks and behaviors
		Like testing Web sites, interacts with buttons

Endpoint Explorer - allows quick way to Test APIs with various methods, submit header, and receive Response all in one window
	You can also create Test Case right from Endpoint Explorer

#Provides sample data automatically instead of question marks - when pulling WSLD file - From "Definition" from Create NEw Project
How does it knows which values to use as sample?
	Its getting all information from WSDL file, Data types, restrictions to decite what is permissible.
#Soap request can validate WSDL fiel via FORM if its properly filled out with valid information.
#WSDL determines UI behavior for Web Service


Quiz
How can soap ui determine what default values to generate / Also soapui know how to validate a form of data that you have filled in.
	By consulting the WSDL
Why is it good that soapui can render JSON as XML
	It makes XPath assertions possible
Want to see what you send on the wire to your service? where should u look
	Raw View
What is NOT a reason to setup multiple requests?
	To make hidden request tabs visible
Where cyou find HTTP header content that returned from service
	Response tab, Header
WSDL is for Web Services. Analogy for REST Api
	Swagger
INstruct soapui to fill in sample values for request
	At Global Preference
What is least information you need to create project that works with REST api
	A sample call to the request

#TestSuites are container of functional tests (TestCases)
#TestSuites can be run sequentially or in parallel.
#TestSuites can be automatically generated and can be implemented into different environment.


Quiz
Why might you want to run TestSuite from command line
	Integration with automated test tool
What do you need to create TestSuite containing REST APIs
	A Sample call to Api
You only want to run 2 out of 3 TestSuite. What to do
	Disable the TestSuite do not want to run
What is utility that runs TestSuites from command line
	TestRunner.bat

#TestCase
-Have two main settings	- preffered unchecked
	Abort test if an error occur
	Fail TestCase if it has failed TestSteps
Debugger lets you pause and analyze  your TestCase

Quiz
Best analogy for TestCase
	Functional test
Building Blocks that compose TestCase
	TestSteps
NOT true about TestCase
	TestCases are only available in Soap services
If Soap created TestCase, what type step does it usually include to start
	A call to API
Which two types soapui tests taht can be generated from testcase
	Load Test & Security scan
What does Debugger NOT provide
	Ability to change properties while test is running
YOu want to pause Testcase to check properties. Easy way to proceed
	Use debugger to insert a breakpoint
What determines to run testcase to completion, despite any problems
	Abort on Error Setting
